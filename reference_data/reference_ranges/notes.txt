1. perl convert_sp_name.pl -i skin_health_status_reference_range.csv -o skin.csv

2. convert 16S copy number and ITS copy number to cell numbers based on rrna database.

3. The pathogen reference table prepared by Janina was coded by windows 1252. First, we need to convert it to UTF-8.

iconv -f WINDOWS-1252 -t UTF-8 filename.txt> new_file.txt

The exotic list contains all pathogens in the non-exotic list plus some genera that are only be considered pathogens in the exotic animals.

AMR distribution in different species are determined by blast AMR genes against selected genomes from NCBI for all species (with >= 5 genomes).

details can be found at debug/midog.abs/AMR_genome_distribution.
concatenated NCBI genomes are saved at: s3://zymo-files/WGS_Pipeline/shotgun_database/AMR_species_distribution_database/concat.seqs/

In the AMR_recommendation_table, A genus should be shown as "Pseudomonas" rather than "Pseudomonas sp."
